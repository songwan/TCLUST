# Trimming approach to cluster analysis

Robust Statistics class project

Clustering is a method of finding groups within data points that are similar to each other. One of the most famous clustering algorithm is `K-means`. However, in terms of robustness, K-means is heavily influenced by extreme observations. To solve this problem, we introduce robust clustering algorithm,  TCLUST  which  has  a  restriction  on  cluster  scatter  matrices.  We  will  describe  the motivation of TCLUST algorithm and mathematical derivation of it on eigenvalue ratio restrictions. Then, we will show how TCLUST is implemented in R and the simulation study results.
